# Iteration-and-Major-Data-Types

This programming assignment is designed to ensure that I know how to use combinations of Python's most important data types to model and compactly write code that solves a wide variety of different programming problems. The kind of abstract thinking that goes into modeling solutions to these programming problems with these data types (and iteration over them) is critical to my development as a computer scientist.
